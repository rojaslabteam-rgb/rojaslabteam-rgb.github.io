## Tips and hints

* Name a file ".md" to have it render in markdown, name it ".html" to render in HTML.
* Go to the [commit list](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/commits/master) (on your repo) to find the last version GitHub built with Jekyll. 
  * Green check: successful build
  * Orange circle: building
  * Red X: error
  * No icon: not built

* Academic Pages uses [Jekyll Kramdown](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/markdown/), GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) parser, which is similar to the version of Markdown used on GitHub, but may have some minor differences. 
  * Some of emoji supported on GitHub should be supposed via the [Jemoji](https://github.com/jekyll/jemoji) plugin :computer:.
  * The best list of the supported emoji can be found in the [Emojis for Jekyll via Jemoji](https://www.fabriziomusacchio.com/blog/2021-08-16-emojis_for_Jekyll/#computer) blog post.

* While GitHub Pages prevents server side code from running, client-side scripts are supported.
  * This means that Google Analytics is supported, and the [wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki/Adding-Google-Analytics) should contain the most up-to-date information on getting it working.

* Your CV can be written using either Markdown or generated via JSON. You can update the path in `_data/navigation.yml`.

* The [Liquid syntax guide](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/tags/control-flow/) is a useful guide for those that want to add functionality to the template or to become contributors to the [template on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io).
